# API-Server-Connector
Testing endpoints from an express server

# Purpose
The Purpose of this server app is to expore the setup enviornment
for making api calls from a node/express server

# *Disclaimer* 
This is an ongoing experimental repository. Explanatory material
is subject to change depending on the knowledge of the writer. 

# Notes to remember
1. When initalizing the package.json, set `type` to `module`. Unless the module does not support ES6 modules, use `module.exports`
2. Remember to change all traditional `module.exports` into ES6 import syntax. 
## Example
> import `import 'dotenv/config';` `import express from 'express'`
3. Use Enviornment variable to protect api keys
4. Expect to read the docs a lot.
